## Introduction

‚≠ê This pet project is dedicated to streamlining microservices development using Aspire, Dapr, and the Radius Platform. Its primary objective is to provide a cutting-edge application development experience that prioritizes developer productivity, scalability, and reliability.

üí° The focus of this project is not only on business logic but also on the architecture, design, and development of a modern microservices application. It incorporates various design patterns, principles and concepts commonly used in microservices, including Domain-Driven Design (DDD), pub/sub, Sidecar Pattern, Event Sourcing, and CQRS.

## The Goals of the Project

- [x] Building a cloud-native application with .NET Aspire and Dapr
- [x] Implementing a microservices architecture with DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing
- [x] Using the Sidecar Pattern to integrate Dapr with existing applications
- [x] Using Vertical Slice Architecture to organize the codebase
- [x] Using Duende IdentityServer for authentication and authorization
- [x] Using Kafka for pub/sub messaging
- [ ] Using NUKE for build automation
- [ ] Integrating LLM with the application
  - [ ] Leveraging the [Microsoft.Extensions.AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/ai/ai-extensions)
  - [ ] Using Ollama with DeepSeek R2 model
- [ ] Integrating with the Radius Platform for deployment
