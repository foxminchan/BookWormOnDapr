## Introduction

‚≠ê This pet project is dedicated to streamlining microservices development using Aspire, Dapr, and the Radius Platform. Its primary objective is to provide a cutting-edge application development experience that prioritizes developer productivity, scalability, and reliability.

üí° The focus of this project is not only on business logic but also on the architecture, design, and development of a modern microservices application. It incorporates various design patterns, principles and concepts commonly used in microservices, including Domain-Driven Design (DDD), pub/sub, Sidecar Pattern, Event Sourcing, and CQRS.
